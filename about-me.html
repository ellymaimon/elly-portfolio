          <h4>Why program though?</h4>
            <p>I decided to become a programmer for a myriad of reasons. Mainly, I love the cross between creativity and logical order that programming provides.<br><br> Nothing is more satisfying than diagnosing and solving a problem using the power of code, and making a computer accurately follow objectives to display beautiful work or add interactivity and functionality is incredibly empowering.<br><br> I hope to use my knowledge in programming to create applications that will help people and make the world a better and more connected place to live in.

          <h4>Bread Baking</h5>
          <p>One of my biggest hobbies is baking bread. I love the challenge of keeping a starter alive and flourishing in order to create a lovely unique flavor while baking. Watching my loaf rise naturally is one of the most satisfying feelings, and nothing beats the smell of fresh-baked bread.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Drumming</h4>
          <p>I also have a passion for playing the drums. I've always been a person with a bit of extra nervous energy on reserve, and playing drums is the best way for me to get that energy out in a creative format. It's an outlet that serves as a form of meditation for me, and a good way to train coordination and body dexterity. I've always loved drumming since I was in early high school exploring different genres of music.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Gardening</h4>
          <p>Gardening, to me, is the best way to get in touch with nature. It's rewarding, in that you can literally reap what you sow. You get your hands dirty and give your body a chance to soak up some sun and familiarize itself with bacteria both good and bad. Seeing your plants grow and harvesting fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs is economical, fun, and good for you.</p>
